Viking smart home project for Hacknarock VIII hackathon.

The project consists of:
- Kasia Weather Station - monitors ambient temperature, humidity, and pressure and hosts the system server
- Iza Viking Robot - Remote controlled (either from the weather station, manually, or potentially via social media), gathers fuel to burn in fireplace
Also wields a cool sword.
- Micha≈Ç Remote Controller - In case of robot getting stuck allows the Viking to manually drive the robot.
